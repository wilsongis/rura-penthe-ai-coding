## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before tasks generation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_tasks` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    
    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (interface contracts), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map interface contracts to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT output standard markdown checkboxes. All tasks must be output inside XML `<wave>` blocks (combining 3-4 dependent tasks into batch blocks) optimized for execution.

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Total XML `<wave>` count
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the strict XML `<wave>` format.

6. **Check for extension hooks**: After tasks.md is generated, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
   - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_tasks` key
   - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```
     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```
   - If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

Context for task generation: {ARGS}

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be completely encapsulated in XML `<wave>` blocks to facilitate rapid execution via context-safe mini-sprints.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### XML Wave Format (REQUIRED)

Every execution block MUST strictly follow this XML configuration. Group 3-4 dependent `<task>` elements into a single `<wave>`.

```xml
<wave id="1" status="pending">
  <task id="T001" type="setup" story="US1">
    <name>Create project structure</name>
    <files>src/api/auth.py</files>
    <action>Implement the feature logic.</action>
    <verify>just test</verify>
  </task>
  <task id="T002" type="core" story="US1">
    <name>Implement auth middleware</name>
    <files>src/middleware/auth.py</files>
    <action>Write JWT logic.</action>
    <verify>just test</verify>
  </task>
</wave>
```

**Format Components**:
1. **`<wave>`**: Assign sequential IDs (`1`, `2`, `3`). Set initial status to `"pending"`.
   - Setup phase tasks go in Wave 1.
   - Core implementation spans subsequent logic waves.
2. **`<task>`**: Sequential ID `T001..`, `type` attribute (`setup`, `core`, `test`), `story` mapping (`US1`, `US2`).
3. **Internal Nodes**: Must specify `<name>`, accurate `<files>` paths, explicit `<action>`, and command to `<verify>`.

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Interfaces/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each interface contract → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each interface contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
